Of course, here is a more concise README.md file explaining the code.

C++ Basic Control Flow Programs
This repository contains a collection of simple C++ programs that demonstrate fundamental control flow statements like if-else and switch-case.

Program Explanations
Even or Odd Checker: This program takes an integer from the user and determines if it is even or odd using the modulo operator (%).

Vowel or Consonant Checker: This script asks for a single character and checks if it is a vowel (either uppercase or lowercase) or a consonant.

Largest of Three Numbers: This program prompts the user for three integers and uses if-else if-else logic to find and display the largest one.

Employee Details Menu: This program uses a switch-case statement to display specific employee information based on a menu choice from the user.

Basic C++ Programs
This repository contains a collection of simple C++ programs designed for beginners. Each program demonstrates a fundamental programming concept, focusing on conditional statements and basic input/output operations.

Programs Included
1. Even or Odd Checker
This program prompts the user to enter an integer and then determines if that number is even or odd.

Concept: Basic if-else statement.

Logic: It uses the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is evenly divisible by 2.

2. Vowel or Consonant Checker
This program asks the user for a single character and identifies whether it is a vowel or a consonant.

Concept: if-else statement with multiple logical OR (||) conditions.

Logic: It checks the input character against all lowercase and uppercase vowels.

3. Largest of Three Numbers
This program takes three integer inputs from the user and finds the largest number among them.

Concept: if-else if-else ladder.

Logic: It sequentially compares the three numbers to determine the greatest one.

4. Simple Menu with Switch-Case
This program displays a menu and, based on the user's choice, prints specific employee information.

Concept: switch-case statement.

Logic: It uses a switch statement to execute a specific block of code corresponding to the user's input. A default case handles invalid choices.
